# Output columns explained
unique_name:	midas bucket - sample unique name; There may be multiple rows with the same 'unique_name', this happens because a bucket may contain multiple strains. All rows with the same unique names must be treated as the same bucket.
sample_name:	name of the Week and mice that the sample was collected. In the form W#M#.
midas_bucket:	name of the midas bucket.
Organism:	name of the community strain mapped to this bucket.
Bucket_midas_relative_abundance:	midas relative abundance * 100 for this midas_bucket.
Bucket_imputed_NM_rel_abund:	NinjaMap relative abundance imputed for this midas_bucket.
Org_proportional_rel_abund:	NinjaMap relative abundance for this Organism in this midas_bucket. Sum should equal the buckets NM rel abundance `Bucket_imputed_NM_rel_abund`.
Org_NM_Norm_Read_Fraction:	NinjaMap relative abundance normalized by reads available (not default by read fraction).
Org_initial_prediction:	InvaderCheck prediction for Organism.
Org_prob_missed_2_EP:	Probability that we missed at least 2 `Extreme Nucleotide Deltas`.
Bucket_final_prediction:	Output of this aggregation.
Org_Extreme_Positions:	Number of observed `Extreme Nucleotide Deltas`.
Org_Percent_Coverage:	Organism's Percent Breadth of Coverage.
Org_Coverage_Depth:	Organism's Depth of Coverage.
